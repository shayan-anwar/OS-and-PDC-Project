# OS-and-PDC-Project
The project was initially used for the course of Operating Systems but it was continued in the course of Parallel and Distributed Computinf as well. It was implemented on C using Dev/C++ and it consists of using the Breadth First Search and Depth First Search regularly and then using threads via OpenMP. The implemention of Triangle Counting Algorithm is also done via threads.
